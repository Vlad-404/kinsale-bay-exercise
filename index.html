        <h1>Welcome to Kinsale bay Food Company!</h1>
        <div id="logo"></div>
        <p>The Kinsale Bay Food Company is a small Irish family-owned and family-managed gluten-free company, founded in the heart of Kinsale on the site of the original Kinsale Fish Market. Kinsale was a famous fishing port supplying fish caught off the local coast in a boat known as the Kinsale Hooker which was known to the local area and throughout Ireland. This boat was made by local craftsmen in Kinsale.  It was this picturesque and community-driven village, perched on the South Coast of Ireland, that inspired our owners Jim and Tommy to name us the Kinsale Bay Food Company.</p>
